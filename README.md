# RememberME - Alzheimers Detection Application

A flutter application, Remember ME, for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease. It is an easy to use application which determines the existence of Alzehiemers.

To test the cognitive abilities of the patient we divided the tests into 4 different testing categories,
1. Thinking Tests
2. Concentration Tests
3. Memory Tests
4. Decision making.

We designed tests to measure each one of them by calculating their individual score. All the 4 tests are to be taken at once and a total score is calculated which acts as a determiner for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. To make the application more interactive and helpful for the user, we also added a chatbot made using DialogFlow.
